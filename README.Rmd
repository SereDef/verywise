The goal of `verywise` is to offer a flexible, user-friendly interface to whole-brain analysis of neuro-imaging data that has been pre-processed using [FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). 

The package was specifically designed for the analysis of *longitudinal* (e.g. multi-session) and/or *multi-site* neuroimaging data. 

Currently, `verywise` allows the estimation of vertex-wise **Linear Mixed Models**, and **meta-analysis**, but will be extended to other statistical models in the future.

It can handle imputed (phenotype) data from several packages (`mice`, `mi`, `amelia`, etc.).

Multiple testing correction is currently achieved using MCZ simulations from FreeSurfer.
This means that you will need FreeSurfer installed and correctly set up.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `verywise` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r install, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("SereDef/verywise")

# or 
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SereDef/verywise")
```

## Basic use

```{r load, eval = FALSE}
library(verywise)
```

```{r lmm, eval = FALSE}
# Run a linear mixed model
run_vw_lmm(
  formula = vw_thickness ~ sex * age + site + (1 | id), # model formula
  pheno = long_format_data, # An R object already in memory, or "path/to/phentype/data"
  subj_dir = "/path/to/freesurfer/subjects", # Neuro-imaging data location
  outp_dir = "/path/to/output", # Where you want to store results
  hemi = "lh", # (default) or "rh": which hemisphere to run
  n_cores = 4  # parallel processing
)
```

```{r meta, eval = FALSE}
# Run a meta-analysis
run_vw_meta(
  term = "age", # Which "term" / predictor / effect to pool
  hemi = "lh", # (default) or "rh": which hemisphere to run
  measure = "area", # (default) or any available FreeSurfer metric.
  res_dirs = c("/path/to/study1/results", "/path/to/study2/results"),
  study_names = c("Study1", "Study2"),
  n_cores = 4  # parallel processing
)
```

## Visualization 

To inspect and plot your results, you can use our interactive web application, [verywiseWIZard](https://github.com/SereDef/verywise-wizard). You can run this locally or try it out [here](https://seredef-verywise-wizard.share.connect.posit.cloud/).

Plots can also be generated using `verywise` like so:
```{r plot, eval = FALSE}
# Plot result brain map (requires FreeSurfer for templates and reticulate for interface with Python-based plotting libraries)
plot_vw_map(
  term = "age",
  hemi = "lh",
  measure = "area",
  res_dir = "/path/to/output",
  outline_rois = c("entorhinal", "precuneus"),
  fs_home = "/path/to/FREESURFER_HOME"
)
```
