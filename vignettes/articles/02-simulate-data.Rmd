## Data poor? Simulate yourself some data, son

If you are eager to get started with `verywise` but do not have access to a dataset, 
you can generate both a FreeSurfer nuro-imaging dataset and a phenotype file to go 
with it. The dataset will be have a *verywise structure*. 


```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(verywise)
```

## All in one go 
```{r simualte, eval = FALSE}
# Simulate FreeSurfer and phenotype dataset
simulate_data(subj_dir = "./VeryWiseUserUser/SimulatedExample")
```


## Only brain data 

## Only generate phenotype file
