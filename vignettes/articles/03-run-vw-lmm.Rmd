```{r setup}
library(verywise)
```

The main function in the `verywise` package is `run_vw_lmm` which fits a
vertex-wise linear mixed model to the data. Here is an example:

```{r lmm, eval=FALSE}
# Run a linear mixed model
run_vw_lmm(
  formula = vw_thickness ~ sex * age + site + (1 | id), # model formula
  pheno = phenotype, # An R object already in memory or a path to file
  subj_dir = "./VeryWiseUser/SimulatedExample", # Neuro-imaging data location
  hemi = "both", # (default) which hemispheres to run
  n_cores = 4 # number of cores for parallel processing
  ...
)
```

The function will first check the inputs and then run `lme4::lmer` on
every vertex in both hemispheres.

The most important parameters you need to know about:

-   **`formula`**: the model formula specifying the linear mixed model. This uses `lme4` syntax.
- **`pheno`** : either the phenotype data object (already loaded in the global environment) or a string containing a file path.
Supported file extensions are: rds, csv, txt and sav. 
- **`subj_dir`** : a string containing the path to the FreeSurfer data, this expects a verywise structure. 

You can optionally also specify: 

- **`outp_dir`**: a string containing the path, where do you want results to be stored. If none is provided, a "results" sub-directory will be created inside `subj_dir`. 
- **`hemi`**: which hemispheres to run (default = "both") 
- **`seed`**: (default = 3108) random seed.
- **`n_cores`**: (default = 1) number of cores for parallel processing.
- **`FS_HOME`**: FreeSurfer directory, i.e. `$FREESURFER_HOME`.
