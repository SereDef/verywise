`verywise` was developed to handle complex datasets, with *multiple cohorts/sites* as well as *repeated neuro-imaging measures*. 

In this article we describe how the software expects the input data directory to look like, and what pre-processing steps are necessary to get both your **neuro-imaging** data and your **phenotype** data ready for analysis.

## A `verywise` input directory structure

Here is an example of a typical `verywise` input directory:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("01-folder-structure.png", dpi=200)
```

This is also what you will see if you use our data simulation functions. The phenotype file does not need to be inside the same folder as the neuroimaging data, but we placed it in there to keep things tidy.

If you have more than one neuroimaging site (or "cohort" or dataset, however you want to call it), then each site should have it's own folder. Inside each site folder you should have one sub-folder for each individual measurement (or "session"). These sub-folders should follow the [BIDS convention](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/), so for example: `sub-47_ses-03` will have the 3rd measurement of subject #47. This will be done automatically by FreeSurfer (see next session)

## Preparing your brain data

To obtain brain surface data, you should first run your subjects through FreeSurfer, using the following command:
```
recon-all -s <subject-id> -qcache
```
Don't forget the `-qcache` flag! Full instructions can be found [here](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/QdecGroupAnalysis_freeview), under the header “pre-smoothed fsaverage surfaces”.

The output folder should now look similar to the one you have seen above. Inside each subject-session sub-folder you should be able to find a "surf" directory where the brain surface maps for each hemisphere are saved as `.mgh` files. These are the files we will be using for our analysis. 

## Preparing your phenotype data
So your brain data is all sorted, but you will also need to prepare a "phenotype" dataset where to store your variables of interest (i.e. the exposures and covariates). This can be either saved as a file (e.g., `.rds` of `.csv`), or it can be an R data.frame that you have already loaded in memory. 

Either way, it should it should look something like this: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("01-pheno-structure.png", dpi=200)
```
So this should be in the *"long format"* with different timepoints/groups stacked row-wise. 

The **`folder_id`** column is important because it is used to link the phenotype to the correct brain data file.

... TODO

Note that the phenotype file/data object can also be an **imputed dataset**.
`verywise` currently supports several mi dataset formats, including the outputs of mice, mi, amelia... TODO
