```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

## The data folder structure

`verywise` was developed to handle complex datasets, with multiple cohorts/sites and repeated neuroimaging measures. In order to do so, we enforce some conventions. The data directory folder is expected to have a similar structure to that pictured below:

![verywise folder structure](man/figures/01-folder-structure.png)

<img src="man/figures/01-folder-structure.png"/>

```{r setup}
library(magick)
tiger <- image_read('man/figures/01-folder-structure.png')
print(tiger)
```
