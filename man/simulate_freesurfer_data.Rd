\arguments{
\item{path}{Character string. Directory where the dataset should be created.
Will be created if it does not exist.}

\item{data_structure}{Named list defining cohorts/sites. Each element is a
list with:
\describe{
\item{\code{"sessions"}}{Character vector of session labels.}
\item{\code{"n_subjects"}}{Integer number of subjects.}
}}

\item{fs_template}{Character (default = \code{"fsaverage"}). FreeSurfer
template for vertex registration. This is used to determine the size of
the synthetic brain surface data. Options:
\itemize{
\item \code{"fsaverage"} = 163842 vertices (highest resolution)
\item \code{"fsaverage6"} = 40962 vertices
\item \code{"fsaverage5"} = 10242 vertices
\item \code{"fsaverage4"} = 2562 vertices
\item \code{"fsaverage3"} = 642 vertices
}}

\item{measure}{Character (default = \code{"thickness"}). Surface measure to
simulate. This is used for file names.}

\item{hemi}{Character (default = \code{"lh"}). Hemisphere code: \code{"lh"}
(left) or \code{"rh"} (right). This is used for file names.}

\item{fwhmc}{Character (default = \code{"fwhm10"}). Full-width half maximum
smoothing parameter. This is used for file names.}

\item{vw_mean}{Numeric (default = \code{6.5}). Mean of the simulated
vertex-wise values.}

\item{vw_sd}{Numeric (default = \code{0.5}). Standard deviation of the
simulated vertex-wise values.}

\item{subj_sd}{Numeric (default = \code{0.2}). Standard deviation of the
random intercept for subject (relevant in multi-session datasets).}

\item{site_sd}{Numeric (default = \code{0.1}). Standard deviation of the
random intercept for site (relevant in multi-site datasets).}

\item{roi_subset}{Character vector (default = c('temporalpole', 'frontalpole',
'entorhinal')). Vertex-wise data is simulated by default only within a
smaller subset (~1.5\%) of the total surface. The rest of the vertex values
are set to 0, so they won't be analysed, saving time during estimation.
The region locations are extracted from the annotation files in that
are distributed with FreeSurfer and saved internally in R/sysdata.rda.}

\item{simulate_association}{Optional. If numeric, must be of length equal to
the number of generated files; if character, must have the format
\code{"<beta> * <variable_name>"}. Associations are injected into one small
region (the entorhinal cortex).}

\item{location_association}{Optional string or character vector. If specified,
the association is only present within these ROIs. The rest of the vertex values
will be set to have no relationship with any of the predictors. The region
locations are extracted from the annotation files in that are distributed with
FreeSurfer and saved internally in R/sysdata.rda.}

\item{seed}{Integer (default = \code{3108}). Random seed.}

\item{verbose}{Logical (default = \code{TRUE}). If \code{TRUE}, print
progress messages.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. Vertex-wise data are written to \code{path}
in FreeSurfer-compatible format.
}
\description{
Simulates FreeSurfer-formatted brain surface data for multiple cohorts/sites
and multiple timepoints/sessions. The output folder structure emulates that
produced by the FreeSurfer \code{recon-all} command, with directories named:
\code{sub-<ID>_ses-<SESSION>}.

The vertex-wise data are stored as \code{.mgh} files, with optional simulation
of an association with a phenotype variable.
