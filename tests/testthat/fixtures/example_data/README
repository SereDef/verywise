This is a very small example datasets with simulated brain (i.e. cortical thickness)
and phenotype files.
The datasets was constructed using the verywise::simulate_dataset() function and
it contains two cohorts with 5 subjects each, and 2 measurements per subject
(a total of 40 .mgh files = 5 subjects x 2 cohorts x 2 timepoints x 2 hemispheres)
The phenotype.csv file contains 20 rows (5 subjects x 2 cohorts x 2 timepoints) and
6 columns ("folder_id", "site", "id", "time", "sex", "age"). The same file was also
amputed (randomly injecting missing sex and age values) and then imputed using mice (m=3)
and saved as a mids object.
